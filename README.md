## Summary Statistics

From the summary table, it seems that the lowest standard deviations are for Ramicane, Capomulin, Ceftamin and Propriva treatments. This means that if these treatments have any effect, they yielded the least increase/decrease in tumor volume among all other treatments.

## Bar Plots

A pareto chart of all treatments show thta the number of datapoints among treatments vary between 160 and 230, and that Capomulin and Ramicane have the most datapoints.

## Pie Plots

The pie plot suggest that there is balance among the gender of the mice analyzed in these experiments.

## Quartiles, outliers and boxplots

Among the 4 treatments selected, it seems that Capomulin and Ramicane yielded a final tumor volume within the same range (median between 35 and 40 [mm3]). In contrast Infubinol and Ceftamin are both at the same level, but with final volume of the tumor is almost double. The outlier from Infubinol is disregarded.

## Line and scatter plots

The line chart shows that the tumor volume for mouse b128, which followed Capomulin treatment, seems to be decreasing in time, however a conclusion about the tumor evolution in time shall be evaluater for all mice which followed this treatment type for a conclusion.

Finally, there seems to be a strong positive correlation between the mouse weight and the average tumor volume.
